Local Scopes Cannot Use Variables in Other Local Scopes

```python
def spam():
  eggs = 99
  bacon()
  print(eggs)

def bacon():
  ham = 101
  eggs = 0

spam()
```

Global variables can be read from a local scope

```python
def spam():
    print(eggs)


eggs = 42
spam()
print(eggs)

# output
# 42
# 42
```

Global statement
“In this function, eggs refers to the global variable, so don’t create a local variable with this name.”

"If you ever want to modify the value stored in a global variable from in a function, you must use a global statement on that variable."

### local variable 'eggs' referenced before assginment

```python
def spam():
  print(eggs) # error!
  eggs = "spam local" # if this isn't. then error won't happend.

eggs = "global"
spam()
```

Use of if **name** == "**main**":: This is a common Python pattern that allows you to run code only when the file is executed directly, not when it is imported as a module.
